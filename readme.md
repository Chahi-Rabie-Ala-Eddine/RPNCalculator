# RPN Calculator 

**Version 1.0.0**

## Context : 

This program implements an RPN calculator

## Usability : 

You can add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers contained in a stack that manages the calculation process.

## Reverse Polish notation :

This way of writing arithmetic expressions is relatively intuitive and therefore allows you to write these expressions postfixically

## Application : 

This calculator performs the calculations according to the FILO input order of a stack, displays the current state of the stack at each step, the postfix and infix notation of the current arithmetic expression, and the overall result.

## Example :

For example, the expression "3 × (4 + 7)" can be written as NPI in the form "4 {Ent} 1 7 + 3 ×", or in the form "3 {Ent} 4 {Ent} 7 + ×".
